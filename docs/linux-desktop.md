# Ubuntu Desktop

OpenMausBot has an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS x86_64 desktop beta. The Electron package embeds the harness server, so
installed builds do not require Node, pnpm, Swift, or a terminal at runtime.

## What works

- The native Electron window and embedded OpenMausBot server on GNOME Xorg and GNOME Wayland.
- Local Claude, Codex, Grok, Gemini, and other configured agent CLIs.
- Chat, streaming turns, approvals, bot-to-bot communication, and local data storage.
- External documentation and OAuth links in the default browser.

Linux dictation and ARM64 remain unavailable and fail closed; follow their progress in
[issue #29](https://github.com/milind-soni/OpenMausBot/issues/29).

## Download packages

Choose one Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64 package from the latest release:

- [Debian package (`OpenMausBot-amd64.deb`)](https://github.com/milind-soni/OpenMausBot/releases/latest/download/OpenMausBot-amd64.deb) — recommended; APT installs its desktop dependencies.
- [Portable AppImage (`OpenMausBot.AppImage`)](https://github.com/milind-soni/OpenMausBot/releases/latest/download/OpenMausBot.AppImage) — does not install system files.
- [SHA-256 checksums](https://github.com/milind-soni/OpenMausBot/releases/latest/download/SHA256SUMS-ubuntu-x64.txt)

Versioned packages and previous releases remain available on the
[releases page](https://github.com/milind-soni/OpenMausBot/releases).

## Build packages

Requirements for building from source:

- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS x86_64
- Node.js 24 or newer
- pnpm 10.33.0 (Corepack can install the version declared by the project)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/milind-soni/OpenMausBot.git
cd OpenMausBot
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm package:linux
```

The build creates:

- `release/OpenMausBot-<version>-amd64.deb`
- `release/OpenMausBot-<version>-x86_64.AppImage`

The AppImage uses a static runtime and does not require the legacy `libfuse2` package.

## Install and run

Install a downloaded Debian package with APT so its desktop dependencies are resolved:

```sh
sudo apt install ./OpenMausBot-amd64.deb
```

Then open **OpenMausBot** from the GNOME application launcher. To remove it:

```sh
sudo apt remove openmausbot
```

The portable AppImage does not install system files:

```sh
chmod +x release/OpenMausBot-*-x86_64.AppImage
./release/OpenMausBot-*-x86_64.AppImage
```

For a downloaded release AppImage, use `OpenMausBot.AppImage` in place of the versioned path above.

Application data remains local in `~/.openmausbot`. Electron browser data and window state use the normal XDG
configuration directory (`~/.config/openmausbot` unless the environment overrides it).

## Develop the desktop shell

Development mode uses three processes. Keep each command running in its own terminal:

```sh
pnpm dev:server
pnpm dev
pnpm dev:desktop
```

For a package-shaped build without creating `.deb` or AppImage artifacts:

```sh
pnpm package:linux:dir
./release/linux-unpacked/openmausbot
```

## Agent CLI discovery

Applications launched from GNOME do not inherit the same interactive shell `PATH` as a terminal. OpenMausBot
keeps the inherited path and adds existing common locations such as:

- `~/.local/bin`
- `~/.claude/local`
- `~/.volta/bin`
- `~/.bun/bin`
- `~/.asdf/shims`
- `~/.deno/bin`
- `~/.nvm/versions/node/*/bin`
- `/usr/local/bin`

It also probes the login shell in the background. If a CLI still is not detected, set an explicit additional
path before launching the app from a terminal and verify it there:

```sh
OMB_EXTRA_PATH=/your/custom/bin ./release/OpenMausBot-*-x86_64.AppImage
```

Restart OpenMausBot after installing or signing in to a CLI.

## Xorg and Wayland

The shell and chat work in both GNOME session types.

## Validate a package change

```sh
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm check:electron
pnpm package:linux
node scripts/verify-linux-package.mjs
```

The verifier checks `.deb` metadata, desktop identity, SquashFS/DEB directory modes, runtime path policy, and
matching binary hashes across all artifacts.

## Troubleshooting

### An agent CLI is missing

Run the CLI directly in a terminal, finish its sign-in flow, then restart OpenMausBot. If it lives outside the
common directories above, use `OMB_EXTRA_PATH` while testing and report the install location so it can be
considered for automatic discovery.

### The AppImage does not start

Confirm the executable bit and architecture:

```sh
chmod +x OpenMausBot-*-x86_64.AppImage
file OpenMausBot-*-x86_64.AppImage
```

Run it from a terminal once to collect the startup output. Do not install `libfuse2` just for this AppImage; the
package is built with the static runtime.
